        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language.
            HTML is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between web pages.
             A markup language is used to define the text document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages.

    <div>
        <p> This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand 
            it and manipulate text accordingly. Most markup languages (e.g. HTML) are human-readable. The language uses tags 
            to define what manipulation has to be done on the text. </p>
