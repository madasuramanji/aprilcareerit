    This <span style="color: green;">language</span>  is used to <span style="color: aqua;"> annotate</span> (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand 
    it and manipulate text accordingly. Most markup languages (e.g. HTML) are human-readable. The language uses tags 
    to define what <span style="text-decoration: underline;">manipulation</span> has to be done on the text.
